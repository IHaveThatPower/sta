# Foundry VTT Star Trek Adventures (Unofficial, Forked)

> You <b> MUST </b> own the <a href="https://www.modiphius.net/collections/star-trek-adventures/products/star-trek-adventures-core-rulebook-pdf">Star Trek Adventures Tabletop RPG</a> to play this! This system does not attempt to explain the game or include any ready made characters, features, or items. The system is designed for those who understand the rules and want to play via Foundry VTT.

Welcome! This is a fork of [Mike Schoen's Star Trek Adventures system for Foundry VTT](https://github.com/mkscho63/sta). This fork has diverged heavily from Mike's work and while it should remain compatible with any worlds that started using that system, the actual system code grows increasingly different as time goes on.

I maintain this system for personal use, but post it here on GitHub in the spirit of community collaboration at the heart of Foundry development.

Please visit [Mike's original repo here](https://github.com/mkscho63/sta), as well, which includes a detailed FAQ, wiki, and more.

## Caveat Emptor

My goal in working on this fork is to provide the best system experience for the people I play with. I can make no guarantees about how well this system will work for you and your group.

I keep Foundry up-to-date, and so am unlikely to build in specific concerns for backward compatibility. For example, anyone hoping for this system to continue working in Foundry v9 after Foundry v10 launched would be sorely disappointed!

As this system continues to diverge from its ancestor, I will add additional resources here to explain its use. For now, the original version is your best bet for documentation.

## Suggested Modules

* [STA LCARS UI](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/sta-lcars-ui): A major visual facelift of the module's UI. **I use this, so I can't actaully guarantee that the base CSS looks correct without it!**
* _STA Tracker Journal_ (Coming Soon): A modification to the system's momentum/threat tracker that makes its headers clickable links to correspondingly-named journal entries. Currently being tested by my playgroup; not yet released to public.
* _STA Bridge Stations_ (Coming Soon): A floating window shared across users that allows for the creation of bridge stations and assigning of characters to those stations. Currently being tested by my playgroup; not yet released to public.
* _STA Alert Status_ (Coming Soon): A macro-triggered UI revamp that plays an alert sound and updates the UI to reflect yellow or red alert. Currently being tested by my playgroup; not yet released to public.
